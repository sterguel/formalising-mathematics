# Formalising Mathematics Courseworks

## Coursework 1

#### The Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem

- Proof that every bounded+monotone sequence converges

## Coursework 2

#### Every PID is a UFD

- Definition and basic facts about ideals, principal ideals and sum ideals

- Definition of integral domains, PID, UFD (these are defined as atomic integral domains where every irreducible is prime)

- Proof that PIDs are Noetherian

## Coursework 3

#### The equation $X^2 + 1 = Y^3$ has only the trivial solution over the integers

- Definition of $\mathbb{Z}[i]$, proof that it is a ring, and proofs of some basic facts

- Definition of Euclidean domains and proof that $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ is Euclidean

- Proof that Euclidean domains are PIDs (and therefore UFDs from the last coursework)

- "Separating powers trick" is sorried :(

- Proof of Bezout's identity and Euclid's lemma for PIDs (not used)

- Proof that a set of integers that is bounded below has a minimum.
